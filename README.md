### Ratthews githubIN profile
I'm a professional tech blogger and software engineer. I believe in future where software empowers every aspect of our lives and lets us all achieve goals previously thought impossible. I'm passionate about culture and world as a whole and strongly believe that this world is unique and should be protected at any cost from pollution and other wrongdoings. I'm personally contributing to preservation of our great planet by:
- not driving a car (*not only because I don't own one*)
- creating a lot of electron apps (*because power which we don't use is wasted - duuh*)
- not farting (*I'll HODL till I'm dead*)
- making sure every good deed I do is documented and shared on social media (*so that I may spread my golden thoughts everywhere*)
- 150g of beans (*it's 2021, wake up people ...*)
- fart in the general direction of people who commit any wrongdoings (*I don't fart, figure of speech ...*)

## Tools and skills
Here are some of the awesome langauges, tools and stuff that I've curated over my 42 years of working as an assistant manager at FAANG, BAANG, DAANG ... etc.

👨‍💻 Tech
- **Javas crypt**: It's my favorite album ever, at first I thought it was a parody of original Java, but then I realized it's much more original, very cool NaN/10.
- **Electron**: My favorite particle ever. Honestly, I wish I was an Electron.
- **DJ Ava**: Classic, I don't think my words could cover importance of this one, but I will try anyways: monumental discovery eqvivalent to realization that earth is actually a rhombus suspended in air by a flock of seagulls pulling on it from above.
- **Rust**: Unlike dust, this one is much harder to deal with, but this makes it much more rewarding. WD-40/10.
- **React J Ass**: This adaptation of Fine Brothers epic series took some getting used to but it's definetly worth your time.
- **See++**: Before discovering See++ I was blind, hopeless fool, living in a small world that I thought was all there is. Now, I'm lost and have no idea what the fuck is going on, but my friends are cheering me on, apparently it's modern to be lost and play it cool. 10/10 I'm modern.
- **Pee HP**: Good paperweight, if you are weird or need something to pass your drug tests.
- **Lara Well**: She is well, we are penpals.

⏲️ Methodologies
- **SCRUM**: This is my favorite thing ever, wow so useful, amazing, I aged 10 years in 2 months, I give ticket DYN42 "dying speedrun" value of 2.
- **Cold showers**: Ah yes, such a good methodology. Sometimes when I couldn't shower I put myself in the fridge for 5 minutes, this is 100% the only thing responsible for my success in life.
- **Coffee**: Ah yes, where would I be without coffee, probably in the store buying some coffee 😆 AM I RIGHT ???? WHERE MY COFFEE DRINKERS AT ??? ☕ 😅 "DEVELOPERS TRANSFORM CODE INTO COFFEE" - Steve Jobs, 2020 🤔.
- **MANagment**: When in position of power, abuse it. Once I was a clerk at the local ice-cream booth and there was this spoiled brat who asked me if he can have an ice-cream, I told him to fix his attitude first - you cannot always get what you want kiddo, he ran away crying. Doomed generation am I right?
- **Post-it not ese**: Here's a free life-hack for you youngesters out there - how can you tell if a project is important? By the amount of post-it notes used to describe it. If your project does not use at least 1000 post-it notes and not even in different colours - your career is officially doomed.
- **Bob Martin-ism**: There is this old guy with hair (*surprisingly he kept it*) and he's talking about things as if they are important, listen to him and one day you will be paid to do opposite of your job description and make big buck for many new developers who will be hired to handle your mess. (*P.S It's not a coinsidence I share my last name with him as I'm his equal like Harry Potter is to Voldemort*).
- **Chair**: Are chairs real?

🍿 Movies
- **Steve Jobs**: This is a movie about a guy called Steve who is a genius inventor and another man Steve who wears turtlenecks. Very inspirational, I'm now building a website in my garage.
- **Game of Thrones**: This movie is amazing, it perfectly captures what finishing a 1 year project in 5 months is like.
- **My SCRUM manager went to Narnia and thought it was McDonalds**: Based on a true story.

📚 Books
- **Clean Code**: Absolute pinnacle of programmer knowledge that can be summed up in not only 1 but 2 sentences: "Don't write your code like you got 5 minutes to live" and "Uncle Bob Martin is a typical Java developer".
- **Design Patterns**: I love this book, so useful man, all the patterns like: Singleton, Singleton 2, Singleton: I'm a kanban machine, Singleton 3 ft. Pitbull and Singleton (2021). 
- **I Am a Garbage Truck**: Sometimes I see people throw garbage on the street. I quickly pick it up. It makes me feel good again and 5 minutes later I'm attempting to summon demons of Selzar and have them strike down arrogant deuchebag/deuchebaguette who thought it's cool to litter.

🥇 Certificates
- **Cable manager V2**: I'm authorized to carry any type of cable.
- **Java Spring, Summer, Autnum and Winter: 4 seasons championship edition expert**: I'm a good coffee drinker, what can I say.
- **OOP(S)**: I'm pardoned for any spillage when carrying coffee.
- **Chess**: I have this because I thought it's somehow related to cheese.
- **JavaScript Hipster god-level threat to startup industry**: I use jabbba script for everything, I have replaced my lymph nodes with node.js, GP thought it was a bad idea but I told him it's best practice these days and he should stop using IE4.
- **Applesoft Binbows 8 apprentice**: My favorite Linux distro is Windows Vista and I use it every day.
- **Programming Electric Cars with HTML5**: Sadly I don't have a car to test my HTML5 autopilot on 😢.
- **Chair heating expert: enterprise edition**: I have mastered the craft of doing nothing for 3 hours after I'm done with work.
- **JIRA psychopath level 100 Shitty ticket writer**: My manager asked me to post his certificate on this list, he has to be included in evertying I do, his name is Dave. (*Dave says hi 👋 btw.*)
- **Hello, World in any language**: Little known fact, I can write a "hello world" program, which makes me an expert at all things programming related and I'm entitled to give my opinion on everything even things that I've never heard about.

## Final notes
I cant read or type. What is this?
