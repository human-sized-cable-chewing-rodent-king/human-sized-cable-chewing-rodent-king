### Ratthews githubIN profile
I'm a professional tech blogger and software engineer. I believe in future where software empowers every aspect of our lives and lets us all achieve goals previously thought impossible. I'm passionate about culture and world as a whole and strongly believe that this world is unique and should be protected at any cost from pollution and other wrongdoings. I'm personally contributing to preservation of our great planet by:
- not driving a car (*not only because I don't own one*)
- creating a lot of electron apps (*because power which we don't use is wasted - duuh*)
- not farting (*I'll HODL till I'm dead*)
- making sure every good deed I do is documented and shared on social media (*so that I may spread my golden thoughts everywhere*)
- 150g of beans (*it's 2021, wake up people ...*)
- fart in the general direction of people who commit any wrongdoings (*I don't fart, figure of speech ...*)

## Tools and skills
Here are some of the awesome langauges, tools and stuff that I've curated over my 42 years of working as an assistant manager at FAANG, BAANG, DAANG ... etc.

👨‍💻 Tech
- **Javas crypt**: It's my favorite album ever, at first I thought it was a parody of original Java, but then I realized it's much more original, very cool NaN/10.
- **Electron**: My favorite particle ever. Honestly, I wish I was an Electron.
- **DJ Ava**: Classic, I don't think my words could cover importance of this one, but I will try anyways: monumental discovery eqvivalent to realization that earth is actually a rhombus suspended in air by a flock of seagulls pulling on it from above.
- **Rust**: Unlike dust, this one is much harder to deal with, but this makes it much more rewarding. WD-40/10.
- **React J Ass**: This adaptation of Fine Brothers epic series took some getting used to but it's definetly worth your time.
- **See++**: Before discovering See++ I was blind, hopeless fool, living in a small world that I thought was all there is. Now, I'm lost and have no idea what the fuck is going on, but my friends are cheering me on, apparently it's modern to be lost and play it cool. 10/10 I'm modern.
- **Pee HP**: Good paperweight, if you are weird or need something to pass your drug tests.
- **Lara Well**: She is well, we are penpals.

⏲️ Methodologies
- **SCRUM**: This is my favorite thing ever, wow so useful, amazing, I aged 10 years in 2 months, I give ticket DYN42 "dying speedrun" value of 2.
- **Cold showers**: Ah yes, such a good methodology. Sometimes when I couldn't shower I put myself in the fridge for 5 minutes, this is 100% the only thing responsible for my success in life.
- **Coffee**: Ah yes, where would I be without coffee, probably in the store buying some coffee 😆 AM I RIGHT ???? WHERE MY COFFEE DRINKERS AT ??? ☕ 😅 "DEVELOPERS TRANSFORM CODE INTO COFFEE" - Steve Jobs, 2020 🤔.
- **MANagment**: When in position of power, abuse it. Once I was a clerk at the local ice-cream booth and there was this spoiled brat who asked me if he can have an ice-cream, I told him to fix his attitude first - you cannot always get what you want kiddo, he ran away crying. Doomed generation am I right? Also why is management not called womangement? Pretty sexist if you ask me.
